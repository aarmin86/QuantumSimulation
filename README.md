# Fast and scalable quantum computing simulation on multi-core and many-core platforms
Overview:

This project presents a high-performance, scalable, and energy-efficient quantum circuit simulator designed to leverage the massive parallelism of GPU clusters. Our implementation focuses on optimizing for speed and power consumption, enabling the simulation of larger and more complex quantum circuits than typically feasible on conventional hardware or less optimized simulators. The code is built to scale efficiently across multiple GPUs, making it suitable for research and development in quantum algorithm design and benchmarking.

Key Features:

High-Performance Quantum Simulation: Achieves significantly faster simulation speeds compared to CPU-based or less optimized GPU simulators.
Scalability on GPU Clusters: Designed to distribute quantum circuit simulations efficiently across a cluster of GPUs, enabling the exploration of larger qubit systems.
Low-Power Optimization: Incorporates techniques to minimize energy consumption during simulation, contributing to more sustainable high-performance computing.
Support for Diverse Quantum Circuits: Capable of simulating a variety of quantum gates and circuit structures, including those relevant to common quantum algorithms.
Modular and Extensible Architecture: The codebase is structured to allow for easy integration of new features, quantum gates, and optimization strategies.
Benchmarking Tools: Includes tools and scripts used for evaluating performance and power efficiency.
